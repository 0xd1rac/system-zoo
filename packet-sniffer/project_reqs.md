# Network Packet Sniffer/Analyzer Project Specification

## 1. Overview

### Title
**Network Packet Sniffer/Analyzer**

### Description
Create a tool that captures network packets in real time, parses the captured data, and provides both a raw view and analyzed output of the network traffic. This project will help you understand low-level network protocols, packet structures, and how to work with raw sockets.

### Technologies
- **Language:** C (alternatively C++ or Python for higher-level analysis)
- **Platform:** Linux (or any OS that supports raw sockets)
- **Libraries:**
  - POSIX Sockets API
  - [libpcap](https://www.tcpdump.org/) (optional, for easier packet capture)
  - ANSI C Standard Library

---

## 2. Objectives

- **Packet Capture:**  
  Capture live network traffic using raw sockets or libpcap.

- **Protocol Parsing:**  
  Decode Ethernet, IP, and TCP/UDP packet headers to extract useful information such as source/destination addresses and ports.

- **Data Analysis:**  
  Analyze traffic patterns by filtering, counting packets per protocol, and detecting anomalies.

- **User Interface:**  
  Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for starting/stopping packet capture, setting filters, and displaying packet details and statistics.

- **Performance:**  
  Ensure real-time packet processing with minimal latency, even under high traffic loads.

## 3. Functional Requirements

1. **Packet Capture:**
   - Open a raw socket or use libpcap to capture packets on a specified network interface.
   - Capture both inbound and outbound packets.

2. **Packet Parsing:**
   - Parse Ethernet frame headers.
   - Decode IP headers (IPv4 and optionally IPv6), including extracting source and destination IP addresses.
   - Parse TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers.
   - Optionally, support ARP packet parsing.

3. **Filtering Mechanism:**
   - Allow users to apply filters (e.g., by protocol, IP address, port number).
   - Provide command-line options or an interactive mode for filter configuration.

4. **Output and Analysis:**
   - Display raw packet data in both hexadecimal and ASCII.
   - Provide summarized packet information (timestamp, source/destination, protocol, key header fields).
   - Log captured data to a file for offline analysis.
   - Optionally, generate and display real-time statistics (e.g., packet count per protocol, average packet size).

5. **User Interface:**
   - Create an interactive CLI that supports commands to:
     - Start/stop packet capturing.
     - Dynamically set or change filters.
     - Display real-time captured packet statistics.
     - Exit the application gracefully.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Display clear error messages for issues such as permission errors, unsupported protocols, or capture failures.

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  
  The tool must process packets in real time with minimal delay.

- **Portability:**  
  The code should run on Linux systems; using libpcap can extend portability across platforms.

- **Security:**  
  Handle sensitive network data responsibly; ensure logged data is stored securely.

- **Maintainability:**  
  Use a modular design to separate packet capture, parsing, filtering, and UI logic. Ensure code is well-documented.

- **Scalability:**  
  Design the system to allow easy addition of new protocol parsers or features without major refactoring.

## 5. System Design & Architecture

### Module Breakdown

- **Capture Module:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Set up raw sockets or pcap handles.
    - Continuously capture packets from a selected network interface.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - May run on a separate thread or process to prevent UI blocking.

- **Parsing Module:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Decode raw packet data into structured formats (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, etc.).
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Implement a layered approach (e.g., first parse Ethernet, then IP, and finally transport layer protocols).

- **Filtering Module:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Apply user-defined filters to the captured packets.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Filters may be implemented as functions or callbacks that determine if a packet should be processed further.

- **User Interface Module:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Manage command-line interactions.
    - Provide commands for starting/stopping capture, setting filters, and displaying statistics.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Support both interactive and batch modes.

- **Logging/Statistics Module:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Log raw and parsed packet data to files.
    - Compute and display real-time statistics about the captured traffic.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Ensure logging operations do not hinder performance.

### Data Flow

1. **Capture:**  
   Raw packets are captured from the network interface.

2. **Parsing:**  
   Captured packets are parsed into structured headers.

3. **Filtering & Processing:**  
   Parsed packets are filtered based on user-defined criteria.

4. **Output:**  
   Processed packet data is displayed on the terminal and optionally logged to disk.

## 6. Potential Challenges

- **Permissions:**  
  Raw socket operations may require elevated privileges (e.g., root access).

- **Performance:**  
  Handling high volumes of traffic efficiently requires careful buffer management and possibly multi-threading.

- **Protocol Complexity:**  
  Fully decoding all variations of protocols, especially TCP options, can be challenging.

- **Cross-Platform Issues:**  
  Variations in socket APIs between Unix-like systems and Windows.

- **Memory Safety:**  
  Ensure proper handling of pointers and buffers to avoid security issues like buffer overflows.

---

## 7. Testing & Evaluation

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Develop tests for individual modules (e.g., testing the parsing functions with known packet samples).

- **Integration Testing:**  
  Test the complete pipeline using controlled packet generation tools (e.g., `ping`, `curl`, or dedicated packet generators).

- **Performance Testing:**  
  Simulate high traffic scenarios to ensure the tool maintains real-time performance.

- **Security Testing:**  
  Validate the tool against malformed packets and potential exploits.

---

## 8. Extensions & Further Enhancements

- **Protocol Expansion:**  
  Add support for additional protocols such as IPv6, DNS, HTTP, etc.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  
  Develop a GUI using frameworks like Qt or GTK for visualizing network traffic and statistics.

- **Advanced Filtering:**  
  Integrate a more powerful filtering system, potentially supporting BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) syntax.

- **Live Analysis & Anomaly Detection:**  
  Incorporate features to detect unusual traffic patterns, such as port scanning or DDoS attacks.

- **Modular Plugin System:**  
  Allow new protocol parsers and analysis modules to be added as plugins without modifying the core system.
