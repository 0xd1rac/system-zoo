 ## Project 1: Threaded Job Queue (Thread Pool with Work Stealing)

- Use select() instead of threads for handling sockets.
- Add username support, disconnection handling, and message history.

What You'll Learn:

Bonus:
Benchmark your lock performance vs pthread_mutex.

## Project 5: Readers-Writers Problem (Using Condition Variables)
**Focus**: Condition Variables + Locks

**Goal:** Implement the classic Readers-Writers problem:

- How to avoid starvation
- Fine-grained thread coordination

**Bonus:**
Implement both:
- First readers preference
- First writers preference
  
## Project 6: Traffic Light Simulation (Using Semaphores)
**Focus:** Semaphores

**Goal:** Simulate a 4-way intersection:
- Each lane is a thread.
- A central semaphore controls how many cars (threads) can be in the intersection at once.
- Only 1 car per direction allowed at a time (binary semaphore per lane).

**What You'll Learn:**
- Using sem_wait/sem_post
- Managing concurrent access
- Modeling real-world constraints with semaphores

**Bonus:**
- Add pedestrian crossing as another semaphore.
- Add traffic light cycles using timed threads.

## Deadlock Detection Tool

**Goal:**  
Implement a deadlock detection system that tracks locks held and requested by threads.

**What to Implement:**
- A resource graph (thread ‚Üî lock relationships)
- Periodic check for cycles in the graph
- Detection alert if a cycle is found (i.e., deadlock)

**What You‚Äôll Learn:**
- How to track lock ownership across threads
- Graph-based cycle detection
- How real systems (like Java's `jstack`) detect deadlocks

## Rate Limiter or Watchdog Timer with Signals

**Goal:**  
Create a timer-based system that monitors or limits thread behavior using signals.

**What to Implement:**
- Use `sigaction()` to catch `SIGALRM`
- Set interval timers using `setitimer()`
- Use it to limit how often a function runs, or detect if a thread stalls

**What You‚Äôll Learn:**
- Asynchronous signal handling
- Signal-safe functions and reentrancy
- Timers and watchdog patterns used in system daemons

Inter-Process Shared Memory + Semaphores

**Goal:**  
Implement a shared memory message-passing system between forked processes.

**What to Implement:**
- Create shared memory with `shm_open` and `mmap`
- Synchronize access using `sem_open`
- Fork multiple processes that produce/consume messages

 Multicore Lock Benchmarking

**Goal:**  
Benchmark and compare different locking mechanisms across multiple cores.

**What to Implement:**
- Custom test harness using 2, 4, and 8 threads
- Measure throughput and latency of:
  - `pthread_mutex`
  - Spinlock (custom and `pthread_spinlock`)
  - Ticket lock (custom)

**What You‚Äôll Learn:**
- Effects of CPU contention and cache coherence
- Performance tradeoffs between lock types
- NUMA implications

**What You‚Äôll Learn:**
- Shared memory between processes (not threads)
- Named semaphores and lifetime management
- Basics of IPC (Inter-process communication)
