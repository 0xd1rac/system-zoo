# Linux Container Project Specification

## 1. Overview

### Title
**Linux Container Implementation**

### Description
Develop a simplified container runtime that leverages Linux kernel features to isolate processes. The project will demonstrate how namespaces, cgroups, and other security mechanisms can be used to create isolated environments similar to Docker or LXC containers.

### Technologies
- **Language:** C (or C++/Go for higher-level implementations)
- **Platform:** Linux (requires kernel support for namespaces, cgroups, etc.)
- **Kernel Features:** Linux Namespaces, Control Groups (cgroups), chroot, seccomp (optional)
- **Libraries:**  
  - Standard C library (`libc`)
  - Linux system calls for namespace and cgroup management
  - Optionally, libseccomp for syscall filtering

---

## 2. Objectives

- **Process Isolation:**  
  Use Linux namespaces to isolate the container's view of the system (PID, UTS, Mount, Network, and IPC namespaces).

- **Resource Limiting:**  
  Implement control groups (cgroups) to limit the container's CPU, memory, and I/O usage.

- **Filesystem Isolation:**  
  Utilize `chroot` (or pivot_root) to change the container's root filesystem, creating an isolated environment.

- **Security Hardening:**  
  Optionally integrate seccomp to restrict system calls within the container for enhanced security.

- **Container Lifecycle Management:**  
  Provide basic commands to create, run, and destroy containers, including handling the process lifecycle and cleanup.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

1. **Container Creation:**
   - Initialize a new container by setting up namespaces (e.g., UTS, PID, Mount, Network, IPC).
   - Create a new cgroup for resource limits.
   - Change the root filesystem using `chroot` or `pivot_root`.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Launch a user-specified process within the container environment.
   - Maintain process isolation so that the containerized process does not see processes running on the host.

3. **Resource Management:**
   - Apply cgroup limits for CPU, memory, and I/O.
   - Monitor resource usage and enforce limits.

4. **Security and Isolation:**
   - Optionally, use seccomp to restrict the set of available system calls.
   - Ensure that container processes cannot interfere with the host or other containers.

5. **Container Lifecycle Commands:**
   - **Start:** Initialize and run the container.
   - **Stop/Destroy:** Terminate container processes and clean up namespaces and cgroups.
   - **Status:** Display running container information and resource usage statistics.

6. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Provide logs for container startup, execution, and termination events.
   - Optionally, output container resource usage for debugging or performance analysis.

---

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  
  The container runtime should impose minimal overhead compared to running processes directly on the host.

- **Security:**  
  Ensure robust isolation between containers and the host system. Validate that resource limits and syscall filtering are correctly applied.

- **Portability:**  
  Target modern Linux distributions with kernel versions supporting the necessary namespaces and cgroup features.

- **Maintainability:**  
  Code should be modular, with clear separation between namespace management, resource control, and process management. Document each module and provide inline comments.

- **Usability:**  
  Provide a clear command-line interface (CLI) for managing containers, with comprehensive error messages and help documentation.

## 5. System Design & Architecture

### 5.1. Module Breakdown

- **Namespace Manager:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Create and manage Linux namespaces (PID, UTS, Mount, etc.).
    - Set up isolation using clone system calls with the appropriate flags.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Ensure that namespaces are correctly cleaned up when the container exits.

- **Cgroup Manager:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Create and configure cgroups for CPU, memory, and I/O limitations.
    - Monitor resource usage and enforce limits.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Interact with the cgroup filesystem (or use libcg if available).

- **Filesystem Isolator:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Change the root filesystem of the container using `chroot` or `pivot_root`.
    - Set up necessary mount points (e.g., `/proc`, `/dev`) within the container.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Handle cleanup and unmounting when the container stops.

- **Process Launcher:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Fork and execute the user-specified process inside the isolated container environment.
    - Manage process signals and lifecycle.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Use proper error handling and ensure processes are terminated cleanly.

- **Security Module (Optional):**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Implement seccomp filters to restrict the containerâ€™s system calls.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Customize the filter rules based on the intended container workload.

- **CLI and Control Interface:**
  - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Provide commands for starting, stopping, and managing containers.
    - Display container status, logs, and resource usage.
  - **Considerations:**  
    - Design a user-friendly command syntax and output format.

### 5.2. Data Flow

1. **Initialization:**  
   User invokes a command to create a new container. The CLI passes parameters (e.g., image path, resource limits) to the runtime.

2. **Setup:**  
   The Namespace Manager creates the necessary namespaces, and the Filesystem Isolator sets up the container root. The Cgroup Manager applies resource limits.

3. **Execution:**  
   The Process Launcher forks a new process in the container environment, executing the user command. The Security Module (if enabled) applies syscall filters.

4. **Monitoring and Control:**  
   The CLI allows the user to query container status and resource usage. Logs and statistics are continuously updated.

5. **Teardown:**  
   Upon termination, the runtime cleans up namespaces, removes the cgroup, and restores any modified system state.

## 6. Potential Challenges

- **Complexity of Namespace Management:**  
  Ensuring all namespaces are properly isolated and cleaned up can be challenging.

- **Cgroup Integration:**  
  Properly setting and enforcing resource limits requires careful manipulation of the cgroup filesystem.

- **Filesystem Isolation:**  
  Configuring the container root, especially handling necessary mount points like `/proc` and `/dev`, requires attention to detail.

- **Security Hardening:**  
  Implementing seccomp filters that are both secure and permissive enough for container operations may require fine-tuning.

- **Debugging and Logging:**  
  Debugging isolated environments can be difficult; comprehensive logging and error reporting are essential.

---

## 7. Testing & Evaluation

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Test individual modules (e.g., namespace creation, cgroup setup, filesystem isolation) with controlled inputs.

- **Integration Testing:**  
  Validate the entire container lifecycle by creating, running, and destroying containers in a test environment.

- **Performance Testing:**  
  Benchmark container overhead compared to native process execution under various workloads.

- **Security Testing:**  
  Perform penetration testing on the container environment to ensure that isolation mechanisms are robust.

- **User Acceptance Testing:**  
  Gather feedback on the CLI usability and error reporting to refine the interface.

## 8. Extensions & Further Enhancements

- **Network Isolation:**  
  Extend the runtime to configure virtual network interfaces and apply network namespaces for complete network isolation.

- **Advanced Resource Management:**  
  Implement more granular resource controls (e.g., CPU shares, memory limits) and real-time monitoring dashboards.

- **Graphical Management Interface:**  
  Develop a GUI or web-based interface to manage containers visually.

- **Image Management:**  
  Integrate container image management, including building, pulling, and versioning container images.

- **Orchestration:**  
  Explore simple orchestration features like multi-container networking and service discovery.
